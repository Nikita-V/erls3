What is it?
-----------

Amazon's S3 storage service is a "pay as you go" service for storing
files.  You can use it to serve web content, backup your files, etc.

This s3erl library provides easy access to S3 for erlang applications.

More info at: http://www.amazon.com/b?node=16427261

Requirements
------------

- OTP-R12B (released on 2007/12/05).  Required due to a bug in inets'
  handling of the HTTP 204 code [bug OTP-6982] which is heavily used by
  S3.  Get it at http://erlang.org/download.html

- An Amazon Web Services account - see http://www.amazonaws.com

- rake and ruby

= BUILDING =

Type rake.
The first time, you will need to edit erlang_config.rb.
Re-run rake

= Configuration = 

You'll need to set your credentials to Amazon SDB :
- by passing them as OTP application parameters or
- by setting the AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variable (recommended)

= TODO = 
- Implement Content-MD5 checking
- automatically retry in case of transient failure
- Improve error handling
- Support for EU-based S3 buckets
- Support for streaming objects to/from disk (inets supports streaming
    to disk, but not from disk just now) (harder)
- Usage will probably show some bugs and their ugly faces.
