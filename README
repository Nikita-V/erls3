What is it?
-----------

Amazon's S3 storage service is a "pay as you go" service for storing
files.  You can use it to serve web content, backup your files, etc.

This erls3erl library provides easy access to S3 for erlang applications.

More info at: http://www.amazon.com/b?node=16427261

Intent
-------
Do not use it to upload multiple Gb files. Everything is moved around in memory.
However it should behave pretty well under high load with moderately sized packets.

Requirements
------------

- OTP-R12B (released on 2007/12/05). 

- An Amazon Web Services account - see http://www.amazonaws.com

- ibrowse (http://github.com/cstar/ibrowse/tree/master)

- rake and ruby

- optionally : merle and ketama for caching
    merle is available here : http://github.com/cstar/merle/tree/master
    libketama is available here : http://www.audioscrobbler.net/development/ketama/
    
= BUILDING =

./rebar compile
./rebar install

= Configuration = 

You'll need to set your credentials to Amazon SDB :
- by passing them as OTP application parameters or
- by setting the AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variable (recommended)

= TODO = 
- support ACL configuration
- Improve error handling
- Support for EU-based S3 buckets
- Support for streaming objects to/from disk (should be easy with ibrowse)
- Usage will probably show some bugs and their ugly faces.
